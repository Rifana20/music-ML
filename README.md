# 🎵 Music Genre Recommender using Decision Tree

This project builds a simple music genre recommendation system using a Decision Tree Classifier from Scikit-learn. It predicts the genre based on user features like age and gender.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset `music.csv` should contain user information with features like `age`, `gender`, and the target `genre`.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
4. Predict and evaluate model accuracy.
5. Export the decision tree as a `.dot` file for visualization.

## 📈 Output
- Accuracy score of the model on the test set.
- A `music-recommender.dot` file that can be visualized using tools like Graphviz.
